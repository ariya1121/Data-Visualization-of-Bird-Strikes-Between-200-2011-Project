Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011

Introduction
This repository contains the Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011 project. 
The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize bird strike incidents reported in the United States over an 11-year period. 
The analysis helps in understanding patterns and trends in bird strike occurrences, which can inform strategies to mitigate such events and enhance aviation safety.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

DVBS.pdf: A detailed PDF report on the data visualization of bird strikes.
Dashboard.xlsx: An Excel file containing an interactive dashboard for exploring bird strike data.
Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook with the data analysis and visualization code.
Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011.pdf: A PDF version of the project Detail.
Project Report.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project findings and visualizations.

Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing the main characteristics of the data and visualizing trends and patterns.
Data Visualization: Creating various charts and graphs to illustrate the findings.
Dashboard Creation: Developing an interactive dashboard in Excel for easy data exploration.
Results
Key findings from the analysis include:

The most frequent bird strike incidents by year and month.
Common species involved in bird strikes.
Locations (airports) with the highest number of incidents.
Phases of flight during which bird strikes are most common.
Severity and impact of bird strikes on aircraft.

Visualization
The Dashboard.xlsx file provides an interactive dashboard that includes various visualizations such as:

Time series plots of bird strikes over the years.
Bar charts showing the distribution of bird strikes by species and location.
Pie charts illustrating the severity of damage caused by bird strikes.

Conclusion
This project successfully visualizes the data on bird strikes between 2000 and 2011, offering valuable insights into the factors influencing these incidents. 
The visualizations help in understanding the distribution and trends of bird strikes, which can aid in developing effective mitigation strategies to improve aviation safety.
